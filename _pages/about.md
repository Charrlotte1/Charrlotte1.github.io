## About  
I am Charrlotte, a PhD candidate in human geography at Free University of Berlin.  
<br>

For my thesis, I study the processes and politics of greening [Coimbatore city in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimbatore), to delineate a political ecology of urban forests. My fieldwork traces afforestation projects and the ways in which it reorders relationships between humans, trees, and other beings, in a space activated by modalities of entrepreneurial urbanisation and more-than-human agencies. I aim to bring together stories of human and more-than-human aspirations in uneven landscapes and their contested politics of place, bringing disparate bodies of work from urban studies and political ecologies into conversation.  

<br>
I am looking for authentic conversations and generous collaborations with fellow researchers.
