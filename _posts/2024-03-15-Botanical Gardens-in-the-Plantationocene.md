For a field course for the first semester Geography students, I arranged their visit to the Berliner Botanischer Garten and Museum and introduced the concept of ‘Plantationocene’. The botanical garden and the plantation have nothing in common. One is a place of cultural enlightenment, a sense of quiet in the midst of a busy city, and a concoction of thriving, diverse plants, and an oasis of calm. The plantation is a sign of doom for ecosystems, human health, and community life – even as they largely structure global food production and consumption of commodities. So, why to study the two side by side? What role did colonial institutions such as the botanical garden have in furthering the plantation economy?

<br>

Leaning on the work of organization FDCL such as the podcast here and the work of scholars like Katja Kaiser, I invited the students to experience and situate critically the role of scientific institutions such as the botanical garden.
We discussed the colonial traces in the garden and how it formed a bedrock of the modern capitalist economy. We also had class activities to appreciate the vitality and sentience of plants. I enlist some of our key points of reflection.

The botanical garden in Berlin, like many other gardens at the time, increased its collections of plants from the German Protectorates. Today, the set-up of the botanical garden did not change largely after Adolf Engler’s phytogeographical arrangements (Kaiser, 2016).
Therefore, even today, Haus I and Haus H carry succulents on the “old world” and “new world” respectively (See Figure 2) – these groupings here do not denote a scientific classification based on botanical or biogeographical explanations, but instead use political terms from the ‘age of exploration’. Naming plants was a means of laying claims to ‘discovery’ of exotic plants: it assumed a lack of relationship between plants and native peoples, which was termed as aboriginal production or Urproduktion. Cactus plants named after German botanists (such as Pachyphytym werdermannii named after Erich Werdermann) were on display.

We discussed the disciplines of economic botany and scientific forestry and how it furthered the ordering and classifying of plants and the optimization of arable land for the production of cash crops. Documentaries furthered their understanding of how monoculture plantations simplify and tame ecologies and rely on the exploitation of cheap labour in racialized and gendered ways. Students were encouraged to take a ‘good look’ at the Tropishes Nutzpflanzen (Haus C) of the Botanical garden. The Haus even boasts a spice rack where the commodities are on display vis-à-vis living plants. I was particularly moved when a student mentioned “I am carrying and drinking a hibiscus tea with me on the tour, but I am seeing an hibiscus plant for the first time”. Others mentioned that they were taken aback to look at coffee and ginger, prior to commodification.

We discussed the infrastructure, technologies, and labour that goes into the sustenance of plants. Plants were studied on and cared for in the gardens, based on their needs as living beings. Gardeners were often found watering the plants in the afternoons when we visited the gardens. Piped outlets sprayed mist even in the non-functional Victoria House. Highly insulating glass in the BGBM was recently installed in order to reduce the energy requirement of insulation that is required maintaining a high temperature for the tropical plants. “We think of plants of barely existing, but there is so much to look at..”, mentioned a student. One student reflected how the musky  tropical greenhouse smelled really fresh and strong in the Großes Tropishes Garden. Some students appreciated the flowering plants welcoming an early spring in the Asian garden.

After the walk, students reflected on how it is an arbitrary mixture of plant groupings that does not really make much sense in the real world… or how the garden is an unrealistic collection that does not represent ‘reality’ as it exists out there. Plants from different continents are put together in the same room merely because of their similarities in climatic conditions (we earlier discussed the ‘temporal’ and ‘torrid’ climatic zones as used by botanists until the 19th century). Students also found it problematic that no signs reflect on the colonial history of the garden. “Not all plants are equal in the garden”- some were staged more prominently owing to their size or a quality (eg: the mother-in-law’s cushion exhibit in the Cacti glasshouse) One remarked on the constant denotation of useful insects and pests in the greenhouses. “How pests and useful insects are denoted seems only to be from a human point of view”, this student pointed out.

Overall, the trip seemed to be fairly successful, and students picked on different themes from the seminar. A student summed it up quite nicely: “I didn’t know we could explain so much with the movement of plants” – yes, indeed!
